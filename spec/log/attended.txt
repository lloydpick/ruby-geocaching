Ok for sure I am logging this event as my first....LTF!!!! [:I] [:I] [:P] (Last to Find) "you know how it is" I'm in Hialeah!!! trying to put my son to sleep, and he ended up putting me to sleep. Phone rings and I rushed out the door. Made it to Wall's just in time to join the chaos. I did the ROBOT but not as good as the Bon Jovi crew... Glad to share some fun time with a group of peers I recently found. Definitely looking forward to 9/9 and 10/10.
